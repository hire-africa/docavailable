# Screenshot Prevention Implementation Guide

## Current Status
Screenshot prevention is implemented but requires app rebuild to work properly.

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Clean Installation
```bash
# Remove node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Step 2: Rebuild the App (REQUIRED)
```bash
# For Android
npx expo run:android

# For iOS  
npx expo run:ios
```

### Step 3: Test on Physical Device
- Screenshot prevention often doesn't work in emulators
- Test on a real Android/iOS device

## Implementation Status

### What's Working:
- Service architecture (`screenshotPreventionService.ts`)
- Native Android module (when rebuilt)
- Configuration management

### What's Not Working:
- Native module integration (needs rebuild)
- Actual screenshot blocking

## Testing Instructions

### After Rebuild:
1. Try taking a screenshot
2. Should see black screen if working

## Debugging Steps

### Check Console Logs:
Look for these messages:
```
ðŸ”’ [Chat] Ensuring screenshot prevention is enabled...
âœ… [Chat] Screenshot prevention enabled for chat
```

### Check Native Module:
- Android: Look for `ScreenshotPreventionModule` in logs
- iOS: Look for screenshot prevention success messages

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Android:
- Requires `FLAG_SECURE` in native module
- Must rebuild app for changes to take effect
- Works better on physical devices

### iOS:
- Uses native detection methods
- May need additional permissions
- Test on real device for best results

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Rebuild the app with `npx expo run:android`
2. **Test:** Take screenshots to verify black screen behavior
3. **Debug:** Check console logs for errors

**Remember:** Screenshot prevention is a security feature that requires native module integration. Real protection only works after rebuilding the app.
