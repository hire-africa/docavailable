# üöÄ EAS Development Build + Native Google Sign-In Setup

## ‚úÖ **What We've Implemented**

Perfect! Since you're using EAS development builds, we can now use the **true native Google Sign-In** that shows your saved Google accounts directly in the app - just like CoinW and other professional apps!

## üîß **Required Setup Steps**

### **1. Rebuild Your Development Client**

Since we added native dependencies, you need to rebuild your development client:

```bash
# Build for Android
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Build for iOS
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

### **2. Google Cloud Console Configuration**

1. **Go to**: [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. **Navigate to**: APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
3. **Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (the one ending in `.apps.googleusercontent.com`)
4. **Click on it** to edit

#### **For Android:**
- **Application type**: Android
- **Package name**: `com.docavailable.app`
- **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint**: Get this from your EAS build

#### **For iOS:**
- **Application type**: iOS
- **Bundle ID**: `com.docavailable.minimal`

### **3. Get SHA-1 Fingerprint for Android**

After building with EAS, you can get the SHA-1 fingerprint:

```bash
# Get the SHA-1 from your EAS build
eas credentials

# Or get it from your keystore
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

### **4. Update google-services.json**

1. **Download the updated** `google-services.json` from Google Cloud Console
2. **Replace** the current file with the new one
3. **Ensure** it includes the OAuth client configuration

### **5. Environment Variables**

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=449082896435-ge0pijdnl6j3e0c9jjclnl7tglmh45ml.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

## üéØ **How It Works Now**

1. **User taps "Continue with Google"**
2. **Native Google Sign-In modal appears** (stays in your app)
3. **Google shows your saved accounts** in a beautiful native UI
4. **User taps their account** for one-tap authentication
5. **User is logged in** seamlessly

## üé® **UI Features**

- **Google Logo**: Animated Google logo with scale effects
- **One-Tap Sign-In**: Shows your saved Google accounts

## üß™ **Testing**

1. **Install the new development build** on your device
2. **Test the Google Sign-In** - it should now work properly
3. **Check console logs** for detailed debugging info
4. **Test with multiple Google accounts** on the device

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **If you still get "isSignedIn is not a function" error:**

1. **Make sure you're using the development build** (not Expo Go)
2. **Rebuild your development client** after adding the native dependency
3. **Check that the plugin is properly configured** in app.config.js
4. **Verify your google-services.json** has the correct OAuth client config

### **If the native modal doesn't appear:**

1. **Check Google Cloud Console** configuration
2. **Verify SHA-1 fingerprint** matches your build
3. **Ensure google-services.json** is up to date
4. **Check console logs** for configuration errors

## üéâ **Result**

You now have the **exact same experience** as CoinW and other top apps:

- **Beautiful native modal** with your Google accounts
- **One-tap authentication** - no typing required
- **Completely in-app** - never leaves your app
