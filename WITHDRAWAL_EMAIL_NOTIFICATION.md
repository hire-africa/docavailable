# Withdrawal Email Notification System

## Overview

This system automatically sends email notifications to doctors when their withdrawal requests are completed by an admin. The email includes detailed information about the withdrawal transaction.

## How It Works

### 1. Withdrawal Completion Process
When an admin marks a withdrawal request as "completed":
1. The withdrawal request status is updated to "completed"
2. The withdrawal amount is subtracted from the doctor's wallet balance
3. A debit transaction record is created
4. **NEW**: An email notification is automatically sent to the doctor

### 2. Email Content
The email includes:
- Doctor's name
- Withdrawal amount
- Payment method (bank transfer, mobile money, etc.)
- Bank name and account holder name
- Completion timestamp
- Professional styling with DocAvailable branding

### 3. Files Created/Modified

#### Backend Files:
- `backend/app/Mail/WithdrawalCompletedMail.php` - Email class
- `backend/resources/views/emails/withdrawal/completed.blade.php` - Email template
- `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/WithdrawalRequestController.php` - Added email endpoint
- `backend/routes/api.php` - Added email route

#### Admin Files:
- `Admin/app/api/withdraw-requests/[id]/status/route.ts` - Updated to send email

## API Endpoints

### Send Withdrawal Completion Email
```
POST /api/admin/withdrawal-requests/send-completion-email
```

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "doctor_email": "doctor@example.com",
  "doctor_name": "Dr. John Smith",
  "amount": 150.00,
  "payment_method": "bank_transfer",
  "bank_name": "Chase Bank",
  "account_holder_name": "Dr. John Smith",
  "completed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Withdrawal completion email sent successfully"
}
```

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Admin `.env` file:

```env
BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
ADMIN_API_TOKEN=your-admin-api-token
```

## Testing

To test the email system, run:

```bash
cd backend
php test_withdrawal_email.php
```

This will:
1. Test the email configuration
2. Send a test withdrawal completion email
3. Provide troubleshooting information if it fails

## Error Handling

- If email sending fails, the withdrawal completion still succeeds
- Errors are logged for debugging
- The system is designed to be resilient - email failures don't affect the core withdrawal process

## Email Template Features

- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Professional DocAvailable branding
- Clear withdrawal details in an easy-to-read format
- Call-to-action button to view doctor dashboard
- Proper error handling and fallbacks

## Security

- Email endpoint requires admin authentication
- Input validation on all email parameters
- No sensitive information exposed in logs
- Rate limiting handled by Laravel's built-in mechanisms

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add email templates for withdrawal rejection
2. Add SMS notifications as backup
3. Add email preferences for doctors
4. Add withdrawal status tracking in emails
5. Add multiple language support
