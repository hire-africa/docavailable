# Lock Screen Fix Applied ✅

## 🎯 The Issue You Identified

You're absolutely right! The problem is:

1. **Screen wakes up** ✅ (Working now)
2. **Shows lock screen** ❌ (Not what we want)
3. **App doesn't show over lock screen** ❌ (The real issue)

**Root Cause:** Android needs explicit flags to show activities **over the lock screen**.

---

## ✅ THE FIX I APPLIED

### 1. **Modified Expo Plugin**

I updated `app.plugin.js` to add lock screen flags to **MainActivity**:

```javascript
// Find MainActivity and add lock screen flags
const mainActivity = application.activity[mainActivityIndex];
mainActivity.$['android:showWhenLocked'] = 'true';
mainActivity.$['android:turnScreenOn'] = 'true';
```

### 2. **What These Flags Do**

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `android:showWhenLocked="true"` | Shows activity over lock screen |
| `android:turnScreenOn="true"` | Wakes screen when activity starts |

### 3. **How It Works Now**

**Flow:**
1. **FCM arrives** → Background handler
2. **Notification displays** with `lightUpScreen: true`
3. **Screen wakes up** ✅
4. **fullScreenAction launches MainActivity** 
5. **MainActivity shows OVER lock screen** ✅ (New!)
6. **User sees call interface** without unlocking ✅

## 🚀 Build & Test

### Build Command:
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### Expected Result:
- **Screen wakes up** ✅
- **App opens OVER lock screen** ✅ (No unlock needed)
- **Call interface visible immediately** ✅

---

## 📊 Technical Details

### What the Plugin Does:
```xml
<!-- Before -->
<activity android:name=".MainActivity" />

<!-- After -->
<activity 
  android:name=".MainActivity"
  android:showWhenLocked="true"
  android:turnScreenOn="true" />
```

### Why This Works:
- **EAS Build compatible** ✅ (Uses plugin system)
- **No custom activities needed** ✅ (Modifies existing MainActivity)
- **Standard Android approach** ✅ (Official flags)

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Before (Current):
1. Call arrives → Screen wakes → **Lock screen shows** ❌
2. User must unlock → Then see app

### After (With Fix):
1. Call arrives → Screen wakes → **App shows over lock screen** ✅
2. User sees call interface immediately

## 🔧 Fallback Options

If this doesn't work completely, we have these options:

### Option 1: React Native Libraries
- `react-native-keep-awake`
- `react-native-screen-lock`

### Option 2: Enhanced Permissions
- Request "Display over other apps" permission
- Use system overlay windows

### Option 3: Custom Development Build
- Use `expo prebuild` for full native control
- Implement custom lock screen activity

---

## 📝 Summary

### The Problem:
- Screen woke up but showed lock screen
- MainActivity didn't have lock screen flags
- User had to unlock to see call

### The Solution:
- Added `showWhenLocked="true"` to MainActivity
- Added `turnScreenOn="true"` to MainActivity  
- Plugin modifies manifest during EAS build

### The Result:
- MainActivity will show over lock screen
- No unlock required for incoming calls
- Immediate call interface visibility

## 🎯 Confidence Level: 90%

**Why 90%?**
- Uses official Android flags ✅
- Plugin approach works with EAS ✅
- Standard solution for this problem ✅

**The 10% risk:** Some manufacturers might still require additional permissions.

**Build with EAS now! The app should show over the lock screen when calls arrive! 🔥**

This is the standard Android solution for showing activities over the lock screen.
