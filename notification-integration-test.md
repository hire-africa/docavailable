# Notification Integration Test

## Problem Fixed
The admin communications page was not connected to the mobile app's notification system, so notifications sent from admin weren't appearing in the mobile app.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Admin API Endpoint
**File**: `Admin/app/api/notifications/route.ts`
- **GET**: Fetch notifications filtered by user type and ID
- **POST**: Create new notifications from admin
- Handles recipient filtering (all, doctors, patients, specific)
- Stores notifications in memory (in production, would use database)

### 2. Updated Admin Communications Page
**File**: `Admin/app/communications/page.tsx`
- Connected to the new API endpoint
- Sends notifications via POST request
- Loads notification history via GET request
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 3. Enhanced Mobile Notification Service
**File**: `services/notificationService.ts`
- Added API integration to `getNotificationsForUser()`
- Fetches notifications from admin API first
- Falls back to local storage if API unavailable
- Properly maps API response to mobile app format

## How It Works

### Admin Side:
1. Admin opens Communications page
2. Clicks "Send Notification"
3. Fills out form (icon, recipient, title, message)
4. Clicks "Send Notification"
5. Notification sent to API endpoint
6. Added to admin's notification history

### Mobile App Side:
1. User opens notification page or dashboard
2. App calls `NotificationService.getNotificationsForUser()`
3. Service tries to fetch from admin API
4. If successful, notifications appear in app
5. If API unavailable, falls back to local storage

## Testing Steps

### 1. Start Admin Server
```bash
cd Admin
npm run dev
```

### 2. Start Mobile App
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Test Flow
1. **Admin**: Go to Communications page
2. **Admin**: Send a notification (e.g., "System Maintenance" to "All Users")
3. **Mobile**: Open notification page
4. **Verify**: Notification appears in mobile app

### 4. Test Different Recipients
- Send to "All Users" → Should appear for both doctors and patients
- Send to "Doctors Only" → Should appear only for doctor accounts
- Send to "Patients Only" → Should appear only for patient accounts
- Send to "Specific User" → Should appear only for that user ID

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/notifications
**Query Parameters:**
- `userType`: 'doctor' | 'patient'
- `userId`: string (optional, for specific user targeting)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "123",
      "title": "System Maintenance",
      "message": "App will be under maintenance...",
      "type": "system",
      "recipientType": "all",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "isRead": false,
      "sentBy": "Admin"
    }
  ]
}
```

### POST /api/notifications
**Body:**
```json
{
  "title": "Notification Title",
  "message": "Notification message",
  "type": "system",
  "recipientType": "all",
  "recipientId": "user123",
  "sentBy": "Admin"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "notification": { ... },
  "message": "Notification sent successfully"
}
```

## Configuration

### Admin API URL
The mobile app tries to connect to: `http://localhost:3000/api/notifications`

**For production**, update this URL in `services/notificationService.ts`:
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`https://your-admin-domain.com/api/notifications?userType=${userType}&userId=${userId || ''}`);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing
1. Check if admin server is running
2. Check browser console for API errors
3. Verify admin authentication token
4. Check network requests in browser dev tools

### API Connection Issues
1. Verify admin server is accessible
2. Check CORS settings if needed
3. Verify API endpoint URLs
4. Check authentication headers

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Storage**: Replace in-memory storage with database
2. **Push Notifications**: Add real-time push notification delivery
3. **User Management**: Add user lookup for specific targeting
4. **Analytics**: Track notification open rates and engagement
5. **Scheduling**: Add ability to schedule notifications
6. **Templates**: Predefined notification templates
7. **Rich Content**: Support for images and rich formatting

## Files Modified

- `Admin/app/api/notifications/route.ts` (new)
- `Admin/app/communications/page.tsx` (updated)
- `services/notificationService.ts` (updated)
- `Admin/components/Layout.tsx` (updated - added navigation)

The notification system is now fully integrated between admin and mobile app!
