# Notification System Test

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Notification Service (`services/notificationService.ts`)
- Centralized notification management using AsyncStorage
- Methods: `getNotifications()`, `saveNotifications()`, `getUnreadCount()`, `markAllAsRead()`, `addNotification()`
- Persistent storage across app sessions

### 2. Updated Notification Page (`app/notifications.tsx`)
- **Auto-mark as read**: Notifications automatically marked as read when page opens
- **Removed tick button**: No manual mark-as-read button needed
- **Real data**: Uses NotificationService instead of mock data
- **Filter tabs**: Added "All" and "Unread" sections with counts

### 3. Updated Dashboard Files
- **Patient Dashboard** (`app/patient-dashboard.tsx`): Uses real unread count from NotificationService
- **Doctor Dashboard** (`app/doctor-dashboard.tsx`): Uses real unread count from NotificationService
- **Real-time sync**: Notification counts update based on actual unread notifications

## Key Features

### ✅ Real Unread Count
- Notification button shows actual unread notification count
- Count updates when notifications are read/added
- Persistent across app sessions

### ✅ Auto Mark as Read
- Notifications automatically marked as read when user opens notification page
- No manual action required
- Clean user experience

### ✅ Filter Sections
- "All" tab shows all notifications with total count
- "Unread" tab shows only unread notifications with unread count
- Dynamic empty states based on active filter

### ✅ Persistent Storage
- Notifications saved to AsyncStorage
- Survives app restarts
- Real data instead of mock data

## Testing Steps

1. **Check Notification Count**: Verify notification button shows real unread count
2. **Open Notifications**: Go to notification page and verify all notifications marked as read
3. **Filter Tabs**: Test "All" and "Unread" filter functionality
4. **Persistence**: Restart app and verify notification counts persist
5. **Real Data**: Verify notifications are based on actual user activities

## Files Modified

- `services/notificationService.ts` (new)
- `app/notifications.tsx`
- `app/patient-dashboard.tsx`
- `app/doctor-dashboard.tsx`
